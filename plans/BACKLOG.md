# Threadcount Product Backlog

Features deferred from the Phase A–D rebuild. Use this alongside a Notion page for tracking status.

| Feature | Notes | Schema needed |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| Tag-based filters (activewear, loungewear, formalwear) | Tags are orthogonal to subtype — a hoodie can be both "top" and "activewear" | New `item_tags` table: `(item_id, tag)` or `items.tags TEXT[]` |
| Favorite brands | User follows brands, sees new/featured items in their feed | `brand_follows (user_id, brand_id, created_at)` |
| Featured/new items from favorite brands | Surfaced in For You feed or a dedicated Brands tab | Feed query extension |
| Batch ranking tournament | When adding 5+ items in the same category, run a mini sort tournament instead of 5 sequential binary searches | Algorithmic — no schema change |
| Product-level links | Direct link to purchase each item (e.g. brand's product page) | `items.product_url TEXT` |
| Animated/emoji avatar | Profile avatar styled with user's top-ranked items | `profiles.avatar_config JSONB` |
| Re-ranking a whole category | Let user manually re-order their tops/bottoms/footwear when preferences change | UX design needed — no schema change |
| OpenBrand / Brandfetch integration | Automated logo + color + website data when brands are added | Paid API dependency — revisit at 200+ brands |
| Brand color theming | Brand page uses the brand's primary color as an accent | `brands.brand_color TEXT` (hex) |
| Item condition tracking | New / Like New / Worn — affects ranking context | `closet_entries.condition` enum |
| Re-ranking item images | Let users upload their own photos for owned items | `closet_entry_images` table |
| Item-level comparison history | Show which items an entry has been compared against, and outcomes | Already stored in `comparisons` table — just needs UI |
| People / friends search | Add a "People" section to `SearchScreen.tsx` querying `profiles.username ILIKE query`. Navigates to `PublicClosetScreen` on tap. Add `searchProfiles(query)` to `searchService.ts`. Update search placeholder to "Search brands, items, or people…" when live. No schema change needed — `profiles` table already exists. | None |
| Recommendations tab (fifth bottom tab) | "For You" or "Discover" tab with personalized item recs. Basic version: query items the user hasn't added, weighted by matching subtypes, owned brands, and community popularity. Add fifth tab to `MainTabs.tsx`, create `RecommendScreen.tsx` and `recommendationService.ts`. Advanced version: collaborative filtering via a `recommendations` table seeded by a scheduled Edge Function or external ML job. | None for basic; `recommendations` table for advanced |
| Dark mode (manual in-app toggle) | ThemeContext + NativeWind `darkMode: 'class'` approach. Persist preference in AsyncStorage. Toggle via sun/moon icon in Closet tab header. Add `dark:` prefix variants to all color classes across every screen and component file. Do this after all product functionality and UX work is complete — it touches every file and should be a dedicated pass. | None |
